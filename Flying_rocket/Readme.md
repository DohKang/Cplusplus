Hello all,

I created sfml library based 2D game. It is called Rocket_flying.
This is muliti player game. 
Destroy enemies and Kill a boss to win a game!


Here are some keyboard key information

For player1
w,s,a,d for move.
z to change weapon
x to chagne bullet numbers per shooting

For player2,
number key 4685 for move
number key 7 for change weapon
number key 9 for bullet numbers per shooting


Things to be debug:
I couldn't solve couple of bugs.
1. player 1 and player 2 cannot shoot at the same time. It cause vector out of range problem.(I checked every vector, but I couldn't fix)
2.if player go all the way down, the player sprite cracks
3. I couldn't make sound whenever player shoot.(there is a sound file)

I've spent so much time to fix these, but I couldn't figure out yet. If anybody can give me an advice, I will appreciate it.
Thanks
