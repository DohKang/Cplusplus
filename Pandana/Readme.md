This is Pandanana game. This is Dohyun Kang's first 2D game using sfml library.
You have to setup your visual studio sfml setting to start the code.

You can move Panda with A,D,W,S keyboard keys.
Press mouse left button to shoot bananas.
If Hp bar is filled with all red, the game is over.
Try to catch many bats as possible to collect points.

Thank you.
